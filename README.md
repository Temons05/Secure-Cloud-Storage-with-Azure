# Cloud storage implementation using Azure Services

This project demonstrates the usage of [Azure Storage SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go) and [SQL Database on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-sql/database/) along with JWT tokens for authentication and some other features.

## Features

- Username and Password based user authentication
- Authenticated API calls using JWT Tokens
- Upload files as Blobs to Azure Storage Containers
- Maintains per-user version history for each file uploaded
- List all files uploaded by a specific user after authentication
- Download / Delete files by version
- Good looking frontend (subjective)
